Wherever I plonk the snippet, the comments widget shall appear. Or so I am told...

```html
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="miclgael/comments"
        issue-term="pathname"
        label="comment"
        theme="github-light"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```
